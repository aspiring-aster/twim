# X.nim
A X(Formally known as Twitter) API wrapper library for Nim. Inspired by [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) and [twitter.nim](https://github.com/snus-kin/twitter.nim).

Be aware I only free-tier API access to the X API so I will only develop for those endpoints.

## Endpoints supported:
- POST /v2/tweets

## RoadMap:
- [ ] POST /media/upload
- [ ] Expand POST /v2/tweets
- [ ] Maybe look into basic tier endpoints
